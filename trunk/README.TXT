Description

	ShieldsUp monitors your Earth Shield, Lightning Shield, and Water
	Shield with a clear text display of remaining charges and the name
	of your Earth Shield target. It implicitly supports all talents and
	glyphs which affect the number of charges on your shields.

	Other features include a visible indication when your Earth Shield
	has been overwritten by another shaman, text and sound alerts when
	your shields expire or are removed, and a condensed display for solo
	play and for shamans without Earth Shield.

	ShieldsUp can be configured to show only under certain conditions,
	including group size and zone type. The font, size, colors, opacity,
	and position are also customizable.

Usage

	Options are available in the Interface Options window. Type "/sup"
	to open the window directly to the ShieldsUp panel.
