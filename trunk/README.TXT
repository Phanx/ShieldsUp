Description
-----------

ShieldsUp monitors your Earth, Lightning, and Water Shield spells with
a clear text display that shows the number of charges remaining, and the
name of your Earth Shield target.

Other features include a visible indication when another shaman has
overwritten your Earth Shield, text and sound alerts when your shields
expire or are removed, and a condensed display for solo play and for
shamans without Earth Shield.

ShieldsUp can be configured to show only under certain conditions,
including group size and zone type. The font, size, colors, opacity,
and position are also customizable.
